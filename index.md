## Why OpenMR?

We aim to create a community-driven open forum for people working in MRI research to learn about and discuss open science practices, with the focus of working together on implementable solutions, whether in the form of a software toolbox, a process description, a community project, or a knowledge-sharing initiative. Open discussion is central to our event, therefore, an open mind attitude and readiness to participate is essential.

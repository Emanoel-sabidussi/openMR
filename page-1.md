## What is the OpenMR Benelux Seminar?

Our goal is to welcome attendees from any background (technical or clinical), and discuss topics related to open science practices in magnetic resonance imaging in medicine, including open tools for machine learning applications in MRI; data and code sharing practices; the role of mentoring in facilitating academic careers; the future of open access publishing.
